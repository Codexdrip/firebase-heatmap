Canvas Boilerplate is the go-to solution for quickly creating modern canvas pieces using ES6 and webpack.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repo:

        git clone https://github.com/Codexdrip/allpurpose-webpack.git

2.  Run setup to install all dependencies:

        npm run setup

3. Start Webpack

        npm run start


Your environment should open up automatically at http://localhost:3000 and you should see 'Milk is nice on a black background'.

This setup gives you the ability to use:
Sass,
Images,
Gsap (for animation),
Barba.js (for page transitions),
ScrollMagic (for triggering animations),
more to come...
